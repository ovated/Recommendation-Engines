# Recommendation-Engines
Engineering movie recommender systems using content-based filtering and collaborative filtering with deep learning.


## Description

### Content-Based System

The 'content_based_filtering.ipynb' file contains the Python code for building a movie recommender system using a content-based approach. The code converts the content of each movie to vectors and finds the similarity between each movie. The system then recommends the most similar movies.

### Collaborative filtering System
The 'collaborative_filtering.ipynb' file contains the Python code for building a movie recommender system using the collaborative filtering approach, which uses deep learning to build a model that obtains user and movie embeddings and predicts user ratings. This model can then be applied to movies that the user has not yet seen, recommending highly rated movies.


### Dataset
Below are the two datasets used to build the two recommender systems:

- Content-based filtering: [data](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download)

- Collaborative filtering: [data](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip)


### Objective

To identify the relationship between users and movies and recommend movies based on user preferences.
